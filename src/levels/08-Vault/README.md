# 8. Vault

**NOTE** - Some code has been slightly altered to work with newer versions of solidity and enable us to test the level with foundry. Any where this has been done an accompanying comment gives context for why this change was made.

Goal: Obtain the password and unlock the vault
Caveat: I set the password myself in the factory, but approached the challenge with 'zero knowledge' of the password.
